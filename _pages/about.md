Hei Hei, my name is Alex and with this static website I want to share my personal [blog](/blog/) about cycling, science and my Erasmus experience in Barcelona as well as some coding [projects](/projects/) I enjoy working on.
During the day, I am a student of Cognitive Science and Machine Learning in TÃ¼bingen.

What about the name of this page? `wildug` is an anagram of my last name.
