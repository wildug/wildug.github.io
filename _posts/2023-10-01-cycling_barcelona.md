After two weeks exploring Barcelona, most of the time on a bike, I want to share my experience gathered in this busy and cosmopolitan city. First my incomplete knowledge around obtaining a bike is presented. The second point of this post is to show examples of the cycling infrastructure, mostly built in the last decade.


### How to get a bike?

First, how do you even get a bike? 
One solution would be buying a second hand bike (starting around 70€).
For tourists or temporal residents there are also many offers to rent a bike, for half an hour or at a monthly basis.
The city of Barcelona officially supports a rental service called *bicing*. Their easy recognizable red bike stations are distributed across the city.
There are several [tarif options](https://www.bicing.barcelona/es/tarifas), all of them consist of paying a yearly fee allowing you to use their bike stations.
The hurdle is to obtain a Foreigner Identity Number (NIE) necessary for registering.
This requires a trip to an administration office when you are lucky enough to get an appointment.


For me personally I choose _swapfiets_ as a renting service for 19€ a month. 
This was most of all a convenient but for certain not the cheapest options for a bike. 
The gear shifting is not great, but it has a nice luggage track on top of the front wheel allowing for a good view on my luggage while driving.

### Cycling infrastructure in Barcelona

But why should you even get a bike in such a crowded and dense city?
Next to personal concerns about your environmental impact, the [local government of Barcelona really wants](http://canvidhabits.amb.cat/ca/contaminacio/#1473764844025-9dec8fe2-1808) you to cycle. 
While most people still take the bus, metro or motor scooter a growing number of people use bikes (often bicing) as their mode of transportation.
During my first conversation in Spain, shortly after arriving at the Barcelona-Sants station, I was informed about reduced ticket prices in the context of lowering car dependency in the city.
The issue of noise and air pollution is well known. 
Even a [navigation service](https://airemetropolita.amb.cat/) exists to plan alternative commuting routes along less polluted areas, using live data.
Barcelona also made the news with the announcement of constructing a [*big superblock*](https://www.barcelona.cat/infobarcelona/en/tema/urban-planning-and-infrastructures/turning-barcelona-into-a-big-superblock_1005852.html) in 2020.
In late 2023 you can clearly see the ambitions of being a bicycle friendly city *almost* everywhere.
The first thing I noticed were the physically separated bike paths.
Unlike the Radschutzstreifen (seen on the left or first picture) as we call them in Germany, physical barriers convey a sense of security and increases the distance to motor traffic while cycling.

  Note on the right image the barricade's slight angle from the direction of driving (not everywhere present tho). This prevents the access for motor scooters to the bicycle path while ensuring an easy exit for cyclist.

A nice feature is the median stripe present on all bicycle paths with traffic in opposing directions.
Sometimes bicycle paths also follow the one-way street culture in Barcelona as can be seen below.

The *avenida diagonal*, one of the largest and busiest streets, running diagonal across the entire city and currently in construction, offers a nice bicycle path towards llobregat with pleasant surprises for commuters ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-blkJxyA60&t=1s) is a nice video about the avenida diagonal).

### Tips for cycling in Barcelona

My flatmate noticed that biking during the evening or night is a more pleasant experience since the traffic has calmed down, and you are able to catch a few quiet moments to explore the peaceful city.

Second during driving you should always get a sense about the directions of motor traffic. Especially at intersections, the direction of surrounding one-way streets helps you identify crossing traffic. While this sounds obvious, pedestrians use this simple manuoeuvre as well to cross a red light, leaving cyclist in the opposing direction unattended. 

This leads to the third comment on traversing Barcelona by bike.
Traffic rules are not viewed as strict laws, more as a kind of suggestion.
Many cyclist and pedestrians cross red lights when it is possible. Motor scooter start at the traffic light in the moment the pedestrian's traffic light turns red, not when their respective traffic light turns green. Cars park on every free spot which is available. On the other side, drivers stop at zebra crossings and people do not get as angry as on german roads.

Last but not least a few nice places to cycle along.
First I would recommend Calle del Consejo de Ciento.
It's a beautifully mixed usage street where bikes, pedestrian and service vehicles are allowed.
It spans over a kilometer long, with great squares where you can take a seat and enjoy the city.
When navigating anywhere, I always try to find and excuse to cycle along there.

  Calle del Consejo de Ciento is easily recognizable on google maps in the traffic overlay (red and white striped).

A second nice bike path is along the beach, one can cycle from the W-tower next to Barceloneta along the coast until Besòs with a nice view on the sea. Along the route is the quarter of Poblenou which is worth seeing as well. Poblenou's rambla offers great restaurants for an evening dinner with a more local flare than the old town of Barcelona.

Safe biking and have fun!
